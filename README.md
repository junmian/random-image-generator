# Random Image Generator

## Overview

Random Image Generator is an app that displays a random image using the Unsplash API.

**Note:** The app is in demo mode, which has a default rate limit of 50 requests per hour. As such, this self-learning project in which I learned to use an external API is not intended to be consumed by the public due to the limited requests per hour.


## Usage
If refreshing the page does not automatically generate a new image, it means the maximum limit of 50 requests within the last hour has been reached. Allow up to one hour - when the 50 requests/hour cycle refreshes - to view new images.
